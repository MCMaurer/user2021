# Using R as a Community Workbench for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure

Analogy (1 minute)
------

< not sure what to put here, but I know I want to humanize this project to the 
audience. I used to make electronic music and I'm thinking the analogy of 
a modular synthesizer vs a controller  might be a good analogy.

A modular synthesizer is often a behemoth of wires and knobs, often without a
keyboard. From the looks of it, it's difficult to know where to start.

A controller is an interface to a synthesizer. It's a keyboard that allows you
to connect or even daisy chain different synthesizers. 

The styles repository is a modular synthesizer and sandpaper is a controller
synth. 

Background (2 minutes)
----------

 - The Carpentries is a global community of volunteers that collaboratively develops and delivers lessons to build capacity in data and coding skills (in R and multiple other languages) to researchers worldwide.
 - For the past five years, our collaboratively-developed lesson template (https://github.com/carpentries/styles/) has been the basis for our growing collection of peer-reviewed lesson content.
 - Received grant to scale our lessons via incubator
 - problem: current template does not scale well---it's a lesson website wrapped around a personal blog
 - problem: lesson infrastructure is a bit like op
 - solution: decouple the tools and the content

Barriers (1 minute)
--------


While the lessons themselves were designed to be easy to author, there were two significant barriers in our toolchain for contributors: software installation and style updating.
As our lesson repertoire and community has continued to grow, this template model has not scaled well, resulting in barriers to entry and wasted volunteer time.

Solution (1 minute)
--------

In 2020 we began the process to redesign our template from the ground up using a combination of Râ€™s literate programming ecosystem and GitHub Workflows, resulting in three R packages called [{sandpaper}], [{pegboard}], and [{varnish}] for handling, validating, and styling lessons.
The new approach separates the content from the tools and style, allowing for seamless updates so the maintainers can focus on authoring their lessons and not on the tools needed to build them.
To accommodate the wide array of diverse skill sets in our community, we wanted to ensure the tools could be used by anyone without any prior knowledge of R.

Testing
-------
We will detail how we involved our community in iterated development of the new template with user stories, passive community feedback, community member interviews, and user experience testing.
In the end, we will show how the wide array of tools available in the R ecosystem makes it easy for us to rebuild our lesson infrastructure in a way that significantly reduces the barrier for entry for our community volunteers.
