So, I'm just going to be spitballing here because I'm not sure HOW I want to
tell this story. Yes, I know I want to tell a story, but how to do it is...
well... complicated. I keep thinking about this part here:

title: Using R as a Community Workbench for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure


-------[Ringo voice] What's the point? [/Ringo voice] --------------------------

Talk to your community, cover up the exposed plumbing, and show the plumbers
where the access panels are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Also, the committee's comments give me some direction:

The Carpentries is a _growing_ community, and in order to grow, we need to
create clear on-ramps to contribution. 

From the committee:

> The proposal to separate the content of a lesson from the format in which it
> is presented is an idea that can help generate and maintain lessons. Many
> educators are not web design experts but want/need to share their materials
> online, and learning CSS, HTML can be a big barrier. Also, this approach
> helps to focus on building the lesson instead of the container.

In the end, we will show how the wide array of tools available in the R
ecosystem makes it easy for us to rebuild our lesson infrastructure in a way
that significantly reduces the barrier for entry for our community volunteers.

The question is: how do I focus this talk? During my UseR!2019 talk, I 
structured it as problem -> funding -> discussions -> solution -> future. I 
don't particularly think that style would go well. One of the things I would
like to do here is to have user stories highlighted throughout the talk because 
the scope of this is a bit esoteric (I mean, how many organizations have a large
volunteer force of varying technological expertise that write lessons?) and I
keep falling too deep in thinking of what details to incorporate (e.g. what 
analogies to use for this thing). 

I saw Kari's talk about inclusion at SORSE and it was _really_ good and landed 
well. I'm not sure that I can do something like that, but I need to consider my
audience: people attending the UseR conference. These are not people who need to
be told what R is or what a package is, but these are not all package developers.

The thing is, I _could_ easily make this talk about the implementation itself,
but I don't think that's what the audience is there for. Yes, they are
interested in knowing _how_ we did it, but ultimately, it's more important to 
focus on the community aspect of this because we want to be able to map the 
community we built on top of the new tools we are introducing. 

One question I have is: where do we start? do we assume that people know what
The Carpentries is? We are a large enough organization that our reputation 
preceeds us, but I don't want to alienate people by assuming that they know who
we are. I guess that means start with an introduction. Tracy didn't at RStudio,
but that's because it was an invited talk. 

So...

Introduction

 - mission and values (repeat this throughout the talk)
 - hook: we are a growing community and the R publishing ecosystem is flexible
   enough to give us all the tools we need to reduce barriers for publishing
   lessons and further our mission
 - reminder: there is no right or wrong, only better or worse --- GW
 - reminder: In the Carpentries: you belong

Background

 - growth (need data for this)
 - communities (trainers, instructors, learners)
 - carpentries incubator (++ lessons)

Maintainers

 - user stories

Problem

 - Lesson template was not built to scale (tools we have today were not 
   available three years ago)
 - reminder: our values accept all contributions. What about the people who want
   to contribute, but can't because they don't have the time to figure out how
   to use the template?

Solution

 - First: empathy
 - Second: plan
 - Third: prototype
 - Fourth: basic user testing
   - broad user scope (novice to expert)
   - ask users multiple times about their experience
   - ask them what they wish you asked them

Future

 - Beta release of tempalte on incubator and some official repositories (should be happening around the time of the talk)
 - Release candidate
 - Official release, countdown to deprecation of old template
   (this needs to be beefed up for a better landing)
