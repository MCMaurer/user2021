# Using R as a Community Workbench for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure

This will be the prose of the talk that I will use as the source for the
transcript. Assuming an average 140 words per minute, this should contain no
more than 140 words per section. 

## Introduction

The Carpentries is a global organization of volunteers who strive to teach 
foundational data and coding skills to researchers worldwide. What makes us
stand out is not the fact that we use evidence-based practices in teaching, it's
that we align all of our decisions with our core values which puts people first
and accepts all contributions. 

Our lesson infrastructure was built on the principles of our values to act 
openly, but as the expertise of our contributors broadens and the number of
lessons grow, we are finding ways that our infrastructure was not quite meeting
our values that accepts all contributions and puts people first.

In reimagining an update to our lesson template, we found that the R publishing
ecosystem with pandoc is flexible enough to give us all the tools we need to 
reduce barriers for publishing lessons and furthers our mission. 

In this talk, I will introduce you to our current infrastructure, it's
challenges, our solution, and how we used past and present experiences from our
community to iteratively refine our design. 

And before I move on, I want to remind everyone of two things:

> There is no right or wrong, only better or worse

This quote by Greg Wilson was written after several iterations of the lesson
infrastructure and I put it here as a reminder that the infrastructure we have
right now was working for us at the time and what we come up with will have its
own difficulties down the road, but what is important is that we build something
that better addresses the needs of the community, which leads me to my second
reminder:

> In The Carpentries: you belong

Our values are what drive us and in The Carpentries, you belong, no matter if
you have been working as a systems administrator for a university HPC cluster or
if you have just learned to write your first python script, you belong in our
community and we are working toward breaking down any barriers that prevent y
