# Using R as a Community Workbench for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure


-------[Ringo voice] What's the point? [/Ringo voice] --------------------------

Talk to your community, cover up the exposed plumbing, and show the plumbers
where the access panels are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Carpentries is a _growing_ community, and in order to grow, we need to create clear on-ramps to contribution. 

From the committee:

> The proposal to separate the content of a lesson from the format in which it
> is presented is an idea that can help generate and maintain lessons. Many
> educators are not web design experts but want/need to share their materials
> online, and learning CSS, HTML can be a big barrier. Also, this approach
> helps to focus on building the lesson instead of the container.

In the end, we will show how the wide array of tools available in the R
ecosystem makes it easy for us to rebuild our lesson infrastructure in a way
that significantly reduces the barrier for entry for our community volunteers.

Background (2 minutes)
----------

In The Carpentries community, we champion people first
 - must remove barriers to contribution


 - The Carpentries is a global community of volunteers that collaboratively develops and delivers lessons to build capacity in data and coding skills (in R and multiple other languages) to researchers worldwide.
 - For the past five years, our collaboratively-developed lesson template (https://github.com/carpentries/styles/) has been the basis for our growing collection of peer-reviewed lesson content.
 - Received grant to scale our lessons via incubator
 - problem: current template does not scale well---it's a lesson website wrapped around a personal blog
 - problem: lesson infrastructure is a bit like op
 - solution: decouple the tools and the content

User Story (2 minutes)
----------

Yoo Nix is a research software engineer who has written several python packages
for image processing and spectroscopic analysis. She uses Arch Linux and has
over 10 years of programming experience. She has been a maintainer on the Git
lesson for several years and enjoys tinkering with code. Yoo finds no problem
keeping the software stack for The Carpentries lesson template up to date and
she is uninterested in learning R.

Poly Gon is a graduate student researcher interested in understanding how
climate change affects different communities in cities around the world. She is
the only one in her group who knows how to use the complex spatial modelling
packages and became a maintainer of the geospatial lesson in R because she
wanted to help her lab understand the software better and gain experience
working on a large collaborative project on GitHub. Poly avoids installing the
Carpentries lesson template infrastructure on her computer and finds it easier
to push changes and hope they work. 

Cole E. Optera is an entomologist who is compotent with the shell, Git, and
python. Cole recently became an instructor. He is interested in contributing a
lesson to The Carpentries to teach entomologists how to use imageJ, but feels
intimidated by The Carpentries template because it's not clear to him where he
should add his lesson materials and finds it difficult to install Ruby and
Jekyll on his Windows computer. 


Barriers (1 minute)
--------

While the lessons themselves were designed to be easy to author, there were two significant barriers in our toolchain for contributors: software installation and style updating.
As our lesson repertoire and community has continued to grow, this template model has not scaled well, resulting in barriers to entry and wasted volunteer time.

Solution (1 minute)
--------

In 2020 we began the process to redesign our template from the ground up using a combination of Râ€™s literate programming ecosystem and GitHub Workflows, resulting in three R packages called [{sandpaper}], [{pegboard}], and [{varnish}] for handling, validating, and styling lessons.
The new approach separates the content from the tools and style, allowing for seamless updates so the maintainers can focus on authoring their lessons and not on the tools needed to build them.
To accommodate the wide array of diverse skill sets in our community, we wanted to ensure the tools could be used by anyone without any prior knowledge of R.

Testing
-------
We will detail how we involved our community in iterated development of the new template with user stories, passive community feedback, community member interviews, and user experience testing.
In the end, we will show how the wide array of tools available in the R ecosystem makes it easy for us to rebuild our lesson infrastructure in a way that significantly reduces the barrier for entry for our community volunteers.
