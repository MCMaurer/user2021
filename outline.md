# Using R as a Community Workbench for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure

This is a relatively detailed outline for a fifteen minute talk. I will use this
as fodder for writing the prose and slides. Each section here should take ~3
minutes and have no more than three slides. 

## Introduction

 - mission and values (repeat this throughout the talk)
 - hook: we are a growing community and the R publishing ecosystem is flexible
   enough to give us all the tools we need to reduce barriers for publishing
   lessons and further our mission
 - reminder: we are always learning
 - reminder: there is no right or wrong, only better or worse --- GW
 - reminder: In the Carpentries: you belong

> Transition: the thing about being an open and welcoming and open community is
> that growth happens and it will test the limits of your infrastructure.

## Infrastructure

 - collaboratively developed lessons
 - all-in-one starter pack (exposed plumbing)
 - value all contributions
 - maintainers were folks who loved to tinker
   - profiles: Yoo Nix; Poly Gon (this is a bit shoehorned in :/)

> Transition: Tolstoy & Desire Paths. This model works for the few maintainers, 
> but time and time again, the contributions show a story that something is not
> working and that means we don't even see the people who are self-excluding.

## Chopportunities

 - growth (we started with six lessons and now have 45 official lessons in two languages)
   - carpentries incubator (>80 lessons; NOTE: work out growth rate from /orgs/{org}/repositories/) 
 - Lesson template was not built to scale (tools we have today were not
   available three years ago)
 - reminder: our values accept all contributions. What about the people who want
   to contribute, but can't because they don't have the time to figure out how
   to use the template?

> Transition: Separate Content from Tools and use tools that are supported by
> friendly communities where folks don't have to feel "techy" to feel like they
> belong. 

## Solution

 - Framework (content + engine + style + validation)
 - Find prior art that matches model; (e.g. {pkgdown})
 - First: empathy
 - Second: plan
 - Third: prototype
 - Fourth: basic user testing
   - broad user scope (novice to expert)
   - ask users multiple times about their experience
   - ask them what they wish you asked them
   - be patient (people will need time to form thoughts, but will still talk)

> Transition: thank yous to alpha testers and people who submit issues/release timeline

## Conclusion

 - We've seen what happens when we release something without user testing first.
   By bringing some users in on the ground floor, we are able to get valuable
   responses and strengthen trust with our community at the same time. 
 - We don't have all the answers, but we have years of organic feedback and are
   always learning. 
 - Funding thank you
